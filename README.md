# SQL-Mini-Project
Week 2 Sparta Global Course Mini Project in SQL.

This project required the use of SELECT, AS, JOINS, GROUP BY, ORDER BY and subqueries to uery the Northwind database.
It also required for me to set up a new database using fake details with the CREATE and INSERT commands.

Questions, code and output excel charts can be found in the pdf.
